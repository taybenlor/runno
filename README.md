# Runno

Runno helps you make runnable code examples that can be embedded in web pages.

This project is based off a number of tools provided by [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/). Wasmer provides a Web Assembly Package Manager ([wapm](https://wapm.io)) and a shell that can execute arbitrary packages from wapm in an in-memory file system using a terminal emulator. Using these tools together we can arbitrarily pull down packages that implement programming languages, and run them in the browser.

This is very handy for programming education it means:

- No need for newbies to install complex programming tools to run code
- Programming examples can be made runnable in the browser with no server
- Simple programs can be tested for correctness inside a sandbox on the user's machine

# Using Runno

Runno is hosted publicly at:

- [https://runno.dev](https://runno.dev) - Website / Host
- [https://runno.run](https://runno.run) - Client

## Client

The client is the virtual terminal application which pulls down packages and
runs code. You can pass query params to it:

- `code` - Some code to run (encoded as [url safe base64](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-safe-base64))
- `runtime` - The runtime to use (e.g. python)
- `editor` - Whether to show an editor (default false)
- `command` - A raw command to execute. Text passed as `code` will be available in the file `code` e.g. `cat code`

e.g.

```
https://runno.run/?runtime=python&code=<base64>print("hello world")
```

The runtime also supports being embedded as an iframe. For best results the host should use the following headers:

```HTTP
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

These create a [cross-origin isolated context](https://web.dev/cross-origin-isolation-guide/) which allows the use of `SharedArrayBuffer` used to implement STDIN. Without this Runno will still work using a fallback hack that isn't guaranteed to work into the future.

To control the runtime when it is embedded as an iframe you can use the `@runno/host` package. A simple example would be:

```js
import { ConnectRunno } from "@runno/host";

const runno = await ConnectRunno(runtimeIframe);
const { tty } = await runno.interactiveRunCode("python", code);
```

You can see the full API available by looking at `@runno/host`. You can see more examples by looking at `@runno/website`.

## Website

The website helps users make use of Runno. It provides a helper for generating embeds, along with documentation.

## Supported Runtimes

The system supports a number of runtimes based on existing packages published to WAPM. These runtimes are tied to Runno and will be supported by Runno going forward.

- `python` - Runs python3 code, not pinned to a particular version but is at least `3.6`
- `quickjs` - Runs JavaScript code using the [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) engine
- `sqlite` - Runs SQLite commands
- `clang` - Compiles and runs C code
- `clangpp` - Compiles and runs C++ code

## Raw Commands

Raw commands can be run on the shell to be executed without using the existing runtimes. You should only use this if you know what you're doing. This will allow you to execute arbitrary commands from WAPM within the shell. This works similarly to how [WebAssembly.sh](https://webassembly.sh) works.

# Development

## Packages

This repo is broken down into a few packages using [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/):

- `website` - the runno website that includes instructions and examples
- `client` - a static website that exposes the runno runtime to be embedded as an iframe
- `host` - helpers for running code on the client from another website
- `runtime` - a library that provides web components and helpers that can be bundled into your own project for using runno without an iframe
- `wasi-motor` - a library for running WASI binaries in the browser

## Running locally

If you're lucky everything should work after doing:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run bootstrap
$ npm run build  # make sure the dependent libraries are built
$ npm run dev
```

At that point you should be able to navigate to:

- `localhost:4321` - Website
- `localhost:1234` - Client

If you're unlucky then you might have to run the two independently. In two different terminal sessions do:

```
$ cd packages/client
$ npm run dev
```

and

```
$ cd packages/website
$ npm run dev
```

If you edit `host`, `terminal`, `wasi` or `runtime` you will need to re-build them with `npm run build`.

## Testing

Coming soon!

## Runtime / Host binding

The runtime exposes methods to the host using [`post-me`](https://github.com/alesgenova/post-me). These are then connected at the other end. You can find the two ends of these connections in `client/src/messaging.ts` and `host/src/index.ts`.

# About Runno

## How does it work?

Runno uses Web Assembly to run code in the browser. Code runs in a unix-like sandbox that connects to a web-based terminal emulator. This means it behaves a lot like running code natively on a linux terminal. It's not perfect, but it's handy for making code examples run.

When you click run on a Runno example the web assembly binary for that programming language is collected from [WAPM](wapm.io) (the Web Assembly Package Manager). It's then run in a Web Worker, inside a sandbox with an in-memory file system. It's connected up to a terminal emulator and simple IO is routed back and forth.

## Why run in the browser?

The way Runno is built shifts the work of running code examples from the server to the client. Running code examples on your server is risky, it means having to implement protections from potentially hostile clients and limiting resources. This means that it's difficult to build a system that is open for anyone to use.

If you're just writing a blog post, your own course, or writing documentation it's going to be difficult to implement this. You really want to use something that someone else has built. But that would mean running on their servers, which is going to cost them money! By running on the client you eliminate needing any third party involvement.

Plus it's pretty cool that you can just run code in your browser!

## Limitations

The programming languages available are limited by what has already been compiled to Web Assembly using WASI and uploaded to WAPM. A great way to help more languages become available would be to compile your favourite programming language tools to Web Assembly and upload them to WAPM.

WASI doesn't provide a full linux environment, so most system based interfaces won't work. Packages and modules are also difficult to install inside the Runno environment. If you want to import code, you'll need to provide that code alongside your example.

Runno is best for small code examples that use STDIN and STDOUT. That is typically the sort of thing that is taught in a CS1 course at university. This isn't an inherent limitation of the system though! As more work is put into Runno and the ecosystem of tools it depends on, more will become available.

## Security

Running arbitrary code is always going to have some security risks, even if you're running it on the client. The goal of the Runno sandbox is to make it as safe as possible for a client to press run. They should be able to trust that their browser won't do anything they don't expect it to do.

Because Runno runs within the browser on the client, you don't have to worry about it damaging your servers. But we also need to make sure Runno won't damage your clients.

There are two main layers of sandboxing that help make Runno secure:

1. By running as WebAssembly we create a layer of sandboxing, any system resources that the binary wants have to be passed through a layer of JavaScript that Runno controls.
2. By embedding Runno inside an iframe from another domain we sandbox it from any secrets inside your webpage. This prevents Runno from having access to cookies or from making API calls as a user.

With these two layers combined it's difficult for a user to hurt themselves, for you to hurt a user, or for users to hurt each other. But that doesn't mean Runno is 100% safe.

Runno can quite easily be used to hog resources on a client. An infinite loop can lock up a tab. Large binaries can potentially be dynamically loaded from WAPM, using surprising amounts of bandwidth. While not ideal, these are typical risks a user has in navigating to any website.

The intention is for Runno to either disclose security risks upfront, or to fix them. So if you find a security issue with the way Runno works, please [contact me](security@make.expert)!

# Big thanks to

A number of open-source projects and standards have been used to make Runno possible. These include:

- [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/), [WAPM](https://wapm.io/), and [WebAssembly.sh](https://webassembly.sh) - the Wasmer team have built a lot of great tools for running Web Assembly. WAPM, the Web Assembly Package Manager is key to how Runno works. WebAssembly.sh was a great inspiration and starting point.

- WASI and WebAssembly - a bunch of people from various working groups and especially the Bytecode Alliance have been involved in making WASM and WASI what it is today. Thanks heaps!

- [XTerm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) - a fully featured terminal that can be run in the browser

- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net) - a great web-based code editor that's always a delight to integrate

- The extensive work by many in the web development community on making native code and APIs run successfully inside the browser.

Thanks to everyone who has built compatibility layers for the web. The web becomes a better platform with every new piece of software we can run on it!

Also big thanks to my friends who tolerate me constantly talking about WASM. Thanks especially to Shelley, Katie, Jesse, Jim, Odin, Hailey, Sam and other Sam.
